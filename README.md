# Listify 
A chrome extension where you can write your todo's. 

# Demo



# Inspiration 
As a university student, I often have multiple tasks to do in a day. I usually start by writing notes in my notes app for my daily tasks, but sometimes, when switching apps, I forget the tasks entirely. By having this chrome extension, I can simply pop out the extension and write my notes. 

# Technology 
This extension uses HTML and CSS for the building blocks and styling, and JSON with JavaScript to incorporate adding, saving, completing, and deleting tasks. Additionally, the processes are saved in the local storage, so refreshing or closing the browser/extension won't change the processes that were made.

# Usage

If you would like to download my project, these are the steps:
        <ol>
        <li>
          Go to the directory you want in your command line and write:
          ```
          git clone https://github.com/dshah1010/listify.git
          ```
       </li>
       <li>
          Open Google Chrome. 
       </li>
       <li>
          Click on the extensions icon in the top right. 
       </li>
       <li> 
          Click "Manage extensions". 
       </li>
       <li>
          Toggle on "Developer mode" in the top right. 
       </li>
       <li>
          Click "Load unpacked" in the top left and choose the directory of the cloned project. 
       </li>
       <li>
          The extension is now part of your browser and you have the option to pin and use it. 
       </li>
       <li>
          If you want to make any changes to it, simply edit the files, save them, and reload the browser/extension. 
       </li>
       </ol>
